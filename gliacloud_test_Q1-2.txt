1.when we consider both precision and recall for an imbalance dataset

2.when extremum is always occured, it's harmness for some activation function

3. bias means the fitting result between model and training samples, while variance means between model and testing samples. There is a tradeoff between them for model complexity issue

4.when using it in bootstrapped method, overfitting may be resulted  

5.normalize the categorical data in same range for feature augmented and sparse matrix purpose

6. more data, early stop, dropout, regularization, BN or LN related nomalization method
